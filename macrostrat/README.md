# Macrostrat
This web widget plots data on the sedimentary cover and fossil records of North American and Caribbean. It uses the Macrostrat API. 


## Run the App
To run the app in R, you need to have the *shiny* R library installed. Once installed, run the following code:

library('shiny')
runGitHub("shinypaleo", "naheim", subdir="macrostrat")

Running this code will open a new window/tab in your default browser and load the shiny app.
