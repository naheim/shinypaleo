# Live-Dead Analyses
This web widget will use a classic dataset to demonstrate how living and death assemblages are similar and different from each other. Understanding the differences between living and death assembalges is important for understanding how the fossil record is constructed and what types of information is transferred from living communities to the fossil record.

## Run the App
To run the app in R, you need to have the *shiny* R library installed and run the following code:

````r
library(shiny)
runGitHub("shinypaleo", "naheim", subdir="liveDead")
````

Running this code will open a new window/tab in your default browser and load the shiny app. 

**When you're done using the app, return to the R console and hit 'esc'.**
