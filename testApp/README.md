# Test App
This is a test app.

To run the app in R, you need to have the *shiny* R library installed and run the following code:

````r
library(shiny)
runGitHub("shinypaleo", "naheim", subdir="testApp")
````

Running this code will open a new window/tab in your default browser and load the shiny app. 

When you're done using the app, return to the R consile and hit 'esc'.
